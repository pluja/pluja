# 👋 Hi there, I'm Pluja

🔭 I think **privacy is a basic human right**, so I build, teach and fight in favor of privacy. You may want to check some of my best-known projects: [KYCNOT](https://codeberg.org/pluja/kycnot.me), [Yotter (Archived)](https://github.com/ytorg/yotter) and [iseeyour.cash](https://codeberg.org/pluja/iseeyour.cash). I also mantain an **awesome-list** called [awesome-privacy](https://github.com/pluja/awesome-privacy) where you can find plenty of privacy-friendly alternatives to privative services.

If you want to collaborate to any of my projects, you are **very welcome to do so**. 

Reach me by mail at `pluja` at `r3d` dot `red`.

If you like what I do, you can [support me](https://kycnot.me/support)!

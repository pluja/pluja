# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Pluja

ðŸ”­ I think **privacy is a basic human right**, so I build, teach and fight in favor of privacy. This last year I built two of my best-known projects: [KYCNOT](https://github.com/pluja/kycnot) and [Yotter](https://github.com/ytorg/yotter). I also mantain an **awesome-list** called [awesome-privacy](https://github.com/pluja/awesome-privacy) where you can find plenty of privacy-friendly alternatives to privative services.

If you want to collaborate to any of my projects, you are **very welcome to do so**. 

We can chat on [**Matrix**](https://matrix.to/#/@pluja:privacytools.io) (Or: `pluja` at `r3d` dot `red`).

If you like what I do, you can [support me](https://github.com/pluja/pluja/blob/main/SUPPORT.md)!
